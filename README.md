# deshima-atmfit
Python package for fitting an atmospheric transmission model to a DESHIMA spectrum to derive the PWV.

## Overview
deshima-atmfit is a Python package which adjusts and atmospheric transmission model to an atmospheric spectrum obtained with DESHIMA to calculate the PWV. The model used in this package is the ATM model (Pardo et al. 2001). This package enables an in-situ estimation of the PWV and can be used for sensitivity calibration.
